# Phishing - Phishmas Greetings

## Challenge Overview
This challenge focuses on identifying and classifying phishing emails in a simulated corporate environment at TBFC.
The objective is to differentiate phishing attempts from harmless spam by analysing sender details, message content, email headers, and attacker techniques such as impersonation, 
spoofing, social engineering, typosquatting, punycode usage, and malicious attachments. 
The task reinforces how attackers exploit trust, urgency, and legitimate-looking services to gain initial access and steal credentials.

## Learnings
From this challenge, I learned:
- Phishing is a targeted attack aimed at deceiving users, unlike generic spam
- Attackers commonly use impersonation, urgency, and authority to manipulate victims
- Email headers (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, Return-Path) are critical for detecting spoofing
- Typosquatting and punycode can make malicious domains look legitimate

## My Solve 
After carefully learning the theory and understanding the tentative techniques of phishing, I analysed and identified the pattern among all the emails and classified its type.
