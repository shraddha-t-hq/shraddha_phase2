> I like logic and I like files, apparently, they have something in common, what should my next step be.
<br/> **> This challenge demanded that I decrypt the encoded message in the .sal file using the Salea Logic 2 software.**

## Solution:
Recognising the .sal file, I opened it with Saleae Logic 2 software.Then I chose the appropriate analyzer - `Async Serial`. (After trying out the SPI which yeilded nothing).
This generated a long string of text which I analysed from the terminal to find the flag embedded in it.

```

## Concepts learnt
-Through this challenge, I learnt how one of the ways of encrypting messages is in the form of wave signals. These signals can further be decrypted by using a software like the Logic 2
## Notes
-For UART protocol --> use Async Serial analyzer.
