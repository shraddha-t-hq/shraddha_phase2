**The challenge demanded that find the flag by manipulating the jwt token of a website.**


## Solution:
Logging into the website showed that though the credentials were correct due to expiration of token, the login was'nt successful. This hinted towards the manipulation of the jwt token of the request.

Upon following this path **Inspect --> Applications --> Cookies** I stumbled upon the temporal token. I analysed the token using `JWT.io` and found that its expiration date was Jan 1, 1970. This had to change in order to access the following page.
I took the help of GPT and asked it to construct a token with the expiration date of the next day.
