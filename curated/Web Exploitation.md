**The challenge demanded that find the flag by manipulating the jwt token of a website.**


## Solution:
Logging into the website showed that though the credentials were correct due to expiration of token, the login was'nt successful. This hinted towards the manipulation of the jwt token of the request.

Upon following this path **Inspect --> Applications --> Cookies** I stumbled upon the temporal token. I analysed the token using `JWT.io` and found that its expiration date was Jan 1, 1970. This had to change in order to access the following page.
I took the help of GPT and asked it to construct a token with the expiration date of the next day.

Actual Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjowfQ.L4UuI63oMzkmh4clZMZPoANwNxnjiYTtZO90IBhQ8B8
<br/>
Modified Token(exp: 2/12/25): eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0ODczNjAwfQ

Then I refreshed the site to reveal the flag.

<br/>

## Flag:
```
nite{50_y0u_kn0w_h0w_jw75_wOrk_nOw?}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- I learned how JWTs work, including header, payload, and signature structure.
- I learned how the exp (expiration) field uses UNIX timestamps.
- I learned that if the JWT secret key is known, tokens can be forged.
